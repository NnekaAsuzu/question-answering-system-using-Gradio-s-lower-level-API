# Question Answering System using Gradio's Lower-Level API

This project implements a question answering system using Gradio's lower-level API. It features two input fields: one for the context and another for the user's question. The system then outputs the model's response.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the required libraries.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
